1. made directory "Assignment1" under existing cs131 directory.

2. To echo current Shell use command: echo $SHELL
output of the command is: /bin/bash

3. To echo home directory path use command: echo $HOME
output of the command is: /mnt/scratch/SP24_CS131_Jyotika/athishsp24

4. My UID is 1207 and I found this by using command: id -u athishsp24
output of the command is: 1207 
To find the groups I belong to I used command: id -Gn athishsp24
The ouput of the command is:
athishsp24 S78
The groups I belong to are: athishsp24 and S78

5. created new directory "myDir" under the Assignment1 folder.
Removed write permissions using command: chmod u-w /mnt/scratch/SP24_CS131_Jyotika/athishsp24/cs131/Assignment1/myDir

From this temp directory, I am able to cd into the directory. I can also run the ls command. The ls -l command returns "total 0". However, when trying to create files, it returns permission denied since the writing permission was taken away from my user.

6. created new directory "myDir2" and "myDir3"

7. created file "myFile.txt" within myDir2. then moved file to myDir3 using command: mv myFile.txt /mnt/scratch/SP24_CS131_Jyotika/athishsp24/cs131/Assignment1/myDir3

8. found total amount of RAM/Memory in IBM VM and displayed the amount of memory in mebibytes using command: free -m
output of the command:
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:          71367       32004       20377        3504       18985       34400
Swap:          4119           0        4119

9. identifying the operating system version can be done using command: cat /etc/os-release
output of the command is:
NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
VERSION="8.6 (Ootpa)"
ID="rhel"
ID_LIKE="fedora"
VERSION_ID="8.6"
PLATFORM_ID="platform:el8"
PRETTY_NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 (Ootpa)"
ANSI_COLOR="0;31"
CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:8::baseos"
HOME_URL="https://www.redhat.com/"
DOCUMENTATION_URL="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/"

REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8"
REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT_VERSION=8.6
REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT_VERSION="8.6"
the file under /etc/ that contains this information is "os-release".

10. to find the permissions (given to all users) for the file containing the OS version information I ran the command: ls -l //usr/lib/os-release
the output is as follows:
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 592 Apr  6  2022 //usr/lib/os-release

This shows that the owner has read and write permissions, the user group has only read permissions, and all others only have read permissions as well.
