1. find /etc -type f > one.txt 2> two.txt

1a) this command searches for files within the '/etc' directory and its subdirectories, and then redirects any output resulting from the command to two different files. 
- one.txt contains the regular output, including the files found
- two.txt contains error messages or any outputs generated by errors

1b) Using the cat command I viewed both files one.txt and two.txt. File one.txt held all the files under the '/etc' directory and two.txt holds all outputs that had generated errors, as seen each file says "Permission denied".

2.The command I used to find this is: cut -d ',' -f20,21 Global\ YouTube\ Statistics.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -n 3

Explanation: cut -d is used to extract specific columns from the csv file. ',' is the separator of the columns and -f20,21 are the columns that the month and year are within for the top 3 Youtube channels created. Global\ Youtube\ Statistics.csv is the csv file. sort is used to get the month and year combinations. The command uniq -c is used to remove duplicate lines and prefix lines by the number of occurences of each line. sort -rn sorts puts the output in reverse order and sorts it numerically in reverse order. The last part of the command being head -n 3 is used to get the top 3 lines from the sorted output, which would be Dataset, Top 3 [Month, Year] with the most number of YouTube channels created.

The output of the command is:

15 2006,Mar
13 2014,Jul
12 2014,Aug

This gives me the answer I want, and I can format it as so:

1. March,2006 with 15 channels
2. July,2014 with 13 channels
3. August,2014 with 12 channels

3. The command I would use to find all the processes owned by me is: ps -u athishsp24

the output of the command is:

4014042 ?        00:00:04 systemd
4014044 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
4014050 ?        00:00:00 sshd
4014051 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
4045220 pts/1    00:00:00 ps

4. Open 2 terminals and login to the IBM VM.

4a) Run command vi file.txt in first terminal

4b) Run command ps -u athishsp24 in second terminal. The output of the command is:

4014042 ?        00:00:05 systemd
4014044 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
4014050 ?        00:00:00 sshd
4014051 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
4046076 ?        00:00:00 sshd
4046079 pts/29   00:00:00 bash
4047583 pts/1    00:00:00 vim
4048549 pts/29   00:00:00 ps

I see that the vim process is being listed as well. The PID for the vim is 4047583.

4c) quit vi using q! option.

4d) Run command ps -u athishsp24 again after quitting vi using q!. This is the output of the command:

4014042 ?        00:00:06 systemd
4014044 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
4014050 ?        00:00:00 sshd
4014051 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
4046076 ?        00:00:00 sshd
4046079 pts/29   00:00:00 bash
4056406 pts/29   00:00:00 ps

I noticed that there is no vim listed in the PID list when this command was run compared to the one in question 4b. This happened because I had quit without saving changes on the first terminal using command q!. Apart from that, the PID for ps is different from the ps from part b.

5. The process id for the init process is 1. I used command ps -p 1 for this.

The output of the command is:

PID TTY          TIME CMD
      1 ?        14:13:03 systemd

6. The ps aux is used for obtaining info about all running processes. It offers a thorough list of processes in an easy-to-use format, complete with their process IDs (PIDs), memory and CPU consumption, execution states, and other information.
